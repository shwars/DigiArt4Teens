# Creating Your Own Cognitive Portrait

[Russian Version | Русская версия](README_Rus.md)

Hello!

We are about to explore **Science Art**, where **Science** - namely **Artificial Intelligence**, part of **Computer Science** - will help us create pieces of **Art**! Namely, we will learn the technique called [Cognitive Portrait](http://eazify.net/cognitiveportrait)

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shwars/FaceArt/master/notebooks/img/PhoBoGuy.png" width="30%"/>

In this technique, we use **[Microsoft Face API](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/face/overview/?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-dmitryso)** to extract **Facial Landmarks** from a series of pictures, and then we scale and align pictures in such a way that eyes on all pictures coincide. Merging those photographs, we create an interesting visual effect, like on the photo above. 

## How to Start

All the code and instructions are contained in the [MakeArt.ipynb](MakeArt.ipynb) Jupyter Notebook. You can run it using one of the following methods:

1. Clone / download the repository to the local computer, and open it with [Visual Studio Code][VSCode] with [Python Extension][VSCPyExt] installed. You would also need to install local Python environment, instructions are available [in the Docs][VSCPyDoc]. 
1. Use [Github Codespaces][Codespaces] to run the code directly on GitHub.
1. Open the repository [using Binder][Binder]
